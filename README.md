# taskbarInterface

Implements some of the taskbar extensions discussed at, https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd378460(v=vs.85).aspx
Requires threadFunc class, found at https://github.com/HelgeffegleH/threadFunc note that taskbarInterface.ahk includes this file, manage directories.

This is (mostly) finished, but undocumented. There is an example usage at: https://github.com/HelgeffegleH/UCR (UCR fork)
